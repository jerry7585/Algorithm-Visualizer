An interactive python program that allows for users to visualize different important algorithms.

Customization of the maze so user can choose how they see the algorithm work.

Includes Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, and Dijkstra's(Shortest Path). May extend to more algorithms in the future.

How to use:
1) Left click to place the walls
2) Press 1 and 2 over the box you want to set the start and finish to
3) Right click to remove the walls/start or end points
4) Press d to start depth first search
   Press b to start breadth first search
   Press s to start djikstra's a.k.a. shortest path algoritm
